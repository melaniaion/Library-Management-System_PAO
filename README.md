# Library-Management-System_PAO

The Library Management App is a Java-based program with the primary goal of creating a comprehensive tool to assist with the management of a library's inventory, allowing the librarians to keep track of the books and registered students in a more efficient manner. Also, the students are able to view their borrowed books, as well as check when they are due for return.
